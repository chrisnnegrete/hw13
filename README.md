## LEGO CANDY MACHINE

This project is a hardware-based Arduino electronics assignment that incorporates LEGO and electronics to make a simple candy dispenser.

For this project, I decided to build a LEGO candy dispenser that incorporates electronics for the mechanism. I used to build purely mechanical machines that took coins and 
Include a discussion of how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

## Component Parts

The components of the project include the base, gearbox, pushbutton, Arduino, Adafruit motor shield, Servo motor, USB cable, and the candy to be dispensed. 

The base is composed of three parts: Bottom plate, housing and the magazine for the candy. 
Besides the other electronic components listed above, only a separate breadboard and jumper wires were used to make electrical connections. 

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Build candy machine
- Week 3: Write code, build circuit and solder connections
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

A lot of the challenges came with writing the code. Since this was a simple candy dispenser, and all I had to work with was a continuous rotation servo, I made a simple for loop that moves the slider in the mechaanism back and forth at the push of a button. Incorporating the button was a matter of splicing it into the circuit rather than write it out in the program, since the mechanical system I made allows for a complete cycle in to be made every time the button is pushed. I made a gear train with LEGO components that has a built in clutch to account for any jams or mechnaical problems, which allowed for much more flexbility in tinkering with the code to get the servo positioning just right.
